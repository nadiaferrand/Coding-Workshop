    <h2>Women's Struggle for Water Rights in Kenya
    </h2>

    <p>The struggle for water rights in Kenya represents a critical intersection of women's rights and urban resilience.
        This literature review delves into the existing academic and practical discourse surrounding this topic,
        examining how the struggle for water access encapsulates broader issues of environmental justice and gender
        equality. By critically analyzing the experiences of Kenyan women in their daily fight for clean water, this
        review aims to highlight the socio-political and economic dimensions that influence their plight, contextualized
        within the framework of urban resilience. This case study also offers valuable insights into the theories of
        prominent urban scholars, contrasting and comparing their perspectives on spatial justice and gender inequality.

    <p>Kenya, like many parts of <a href="about.html"> <i> <b>Sub-Saharan Africa </b></i> </a>, faces an ongoing water
        crisis exacerbated by climatic variability and inadequate infrastructure. According to the Red Cross,
        approximately <a
            href="https://www.redcross.org.uk/about-us/what-we-do/international/kenya#:~:text=Kenya%20in%20numbers&text=41%25%20of%20people%20in%20Kenya,on%20the%20Human%20Development%20Index.">
            <i> <b>41% of Kenyans </b></i><a> still lack access to clean water. This scarcity disproportionately affects
                women in rural areas, who spend countless hours managing scarce resources. As David Harvey discusses in
                Social Justice and the City, spatial disparities in resource distribution often reflect broader
                socio-political inequalities. Women, therefore, are left to navigate these complexities without adequate
                support from local or national authorities, highlighting a significant gender dimension in the
                urban-rural divide. </p>

    <ul>
        <li class="items"> Water collection burden in Kenya primarily falls on women and girls</li>
        <li class="items"> This responsibility negatively affects their education, health, and economic opportunities (Thompson, 2001;
            Sorenson et al., 2011).</li>
        <li class="items"> Much of the literature treats women as a homogeneous group, ignoring factors like socio-economic status,
            ethnicity, and age (Crow & Odaba, 2010).</li>
        <li class="items"> This oversight can result in ineffective interventions for marginalized women.</li>
        <li class="items">The physical and psychological toll of water collection is often under-researched and under-quantified.</li>
        <li class="items">A need for more nuanced research to address these issues effectively.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Without consistent access to clean water, women are forced to spend significant time collecting water, diverting
        them from educational opportunities and income-generating activities. This dynamic reinforces poverty and limits
        their socio-economic mobility. Harveyâ€™s notion of "accumulation by dispossession" is evident here, where the
        commodification of essential resources like water exacerbates existing inequalities. The time and effort
        expended on water collection perpetuate a cycle of poverty and hinder women's progress, illustrating the
        deep-seated socio-economic repercussions of water scarcity.</p>
